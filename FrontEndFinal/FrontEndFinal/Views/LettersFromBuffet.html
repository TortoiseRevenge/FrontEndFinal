    <h3>
        A Message From Warren E. Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
    </h3>

    <p>
        Dear Reader,
    </p>
    <p>
        You probably know that I don't make stock recommendations. However,
        I have two thoughts regarding your personal expenditures that can
        save you real money. I'm suggesting that you call on the services
        of two subsidiaries of Berkshire: GEICO and Borsheim's.
    </p>
    <p>
        I estimate that about 40% of all auto drivers in the country can save
        money by insuring with GEICO. The figure is not 100% because insurers
        differ in their underwriting judgments, with some favoring drivers
        who live in certain geographical areas and work in certain occupations
        more than GEICO does. I believe, however, that GEICO more frequently
        offers the low price than does any other national carrier selling
        insurance to all comers. You can quickly find out whether you can
        save money by going to <a href="https://www.geico.com/"> www.geico.com</a> or by calling 800-555-2756.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fine jewelry, watches and giftware will almost certainly cost you
        less at Borsheim's. I've looked at the figures for all publicly-owned
        jewelry companies and the contrast with Borsheim's is startling. Our
        one-store operation, with its huge volume, enables us to operate with
        costs that are fully 15-20 percentage points below those incurred by
        our competitors. We pass the benefits of this low-cost structure
        along to our customers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every year Borsheim's sends out thousands of selections to customers who
        want a long-distance opportunity to inspect what it offers and decide
        which, if any, item they'd like to purchase. We do a huge amount of
        business in this low-key way, which allows the shopper to
        conveniently see the exceptional values that we offer. Call Sean
        Moore or Karen Goracke at Borsheim's (800-642-4438) and save
        substantial money on your next purchase of jewelry.
    </p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>
        Warren E. Buffet
    </p>
